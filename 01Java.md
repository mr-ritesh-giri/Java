# **Types of Programming Languages in the Software Industry**

Programming languages are grouped into three main types:

---

## 1. **Structured Programming Languages**

Structured programming languages organize code using logical constructs like loops, conditions, and functions. However, they do not support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features such as classes, objects, or inheritance.

### Examples:

- C
- Pascal

## 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages**

OOP languages revolve around "objects" that combine data and actions. They include features such as:

- **Classes and Objects**: Fundamental units of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: Sharing properties and methods from one class to another.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing one action to behave differently depending on the context.
- **Data Abstraction**: Displaying only the necessary details while hiding the implementation.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access.

### Examples:

- Java
- C++
- Python

## 3. **Object-Based Programming Languages**

Object-based programming languages use objects but lack full OOP features like inheritance or polymorphism. They provide simpler ways to manipulate data and objects.

### Examples:

- JavaScript (before ES6)
- VBScript
