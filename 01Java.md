Types of Programming Languages in the Software Industry
Programming languages are grouped into three main types:

1. Structured Programming Languages
   These languages use logical constructs like loops, conditions, and functions to organize code. However, they do not support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features like classes, objects, or inheritance.

Examples: C, Pascal.

2. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages
   These languages revolve around "objects" that combine data and actions. They support features like:

Classes and Objects: Basic units of OOP.
Inheritance: Sharing features from one class to another.
Polymorphism: One action behaving differently in various contexts.
Data Abstraction: Showing only important details, hiding the rest.
Encapsulation: Grouping data and methods together and limiting access.
Examples: Java, C++, Python.

3. Object-Based Programming Languages
   These languages use objects but lack full OOP features like inheritance or polymorphism. They offer simpler ways to work with data and objects.

Examples: JavaScript (before ES6), VBScript.
