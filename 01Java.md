# **Types of Programming Languages in the Software Industry**

Programming languages are grouped into three main types:

---

## 1. **Structured Programming Languages**

Structured programming languages organize code using logical constructs like loops, conditions, and functions. However, they do not support Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) features such as classes, objects, or inheritance.

### Examples:

- C
- Pascal

---

## 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Languages**

OOP languages revolve around "objects" that combine data and actions. They include features such as:

- **Classes and Objects**: Fundamental units of OOP.
- **Inheritance**: Sharing properties and methods from one class to another.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing one action to behave differently depending on the context.
- **Data Abstraction**: Displaying only the necessary details while hiding the implementation.
- **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods together and restricting direct access.

### Examples:

- Java
- C++
- Python

---

## 3. **Object-Based Programming Languages**

Object-based programming languages use objects but lack full OOP features like inheritance or polymorphism. They provide simpler ways to manipulate data and objects.

### Examples:

- JavaScript (before ES6)
- VBScript

## **What is Java**

Ever wondered why Java's logo is a steaming cup of coffee? The creators of Java, while brainstorming a name for their new language, chose 'Java', a slang term for 'coffee'. Just as coffee fuels our day, Java powers the tech world with its robust and versatile features.

In this topic, we will explore why Java has been a popular choice among developers for over two decades and how it has brewed success in various domains. We will also introduce you to your very first Java program. So, grab your cup of coffee and join us on this exciting journey into the world of Java!

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language. James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (now part of Oracle Corporation) designed it, and it was released in 1995. The language was developed with the "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) philosophy. This principle underscores Java's key feature - platform independence, allowing the same Java program to run on multiple platforms without modifications.

Java is designed to be both simple and powerful. It borrows its syntax from C and C++, but eliminates certain low-level programming complexities, such as explicit memory management and multiple inheritance found in C++. Unlike these two languages, Java does not require you to manually clean the application memory, as it has a garbage collector that performs this task automatically. Known for its robustness, security, and simplicity, Java has become a popular choice among developers worldwide. It supports different programming techniques, including generic programming, multithreaded and concurrent programming, and functional programming.

## **Where is Java Applied**

Let's go through a typical day and see how Java impacts our lives without us even realizing it.

Imagine waking up to your Android alarm. As you reach out to snooze it, you're interacting with an application built using Java. You decide to work on a project using a development tool like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse. As you write and compile your code, Java is there, forming the backbone of these development tools. During lunch, you enjoy a Netflix show or Spotify music, both services powered by Java. Later, you finish the project and receive payment. Behind the scenes, Java is working diligently, processing your request. In the evening, you unwind with a game of Minecraft, yet another Java-based application.

Java is like a silent friend, aiding us and making our lives easier in numerous ways, from the moment we wake up till we call it a day.
