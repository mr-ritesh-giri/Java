**JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**

Java is a platform independent language because it can run in any OS environment whether its Windows, Linux or MacOS but it needs something called JVM to run otherwise it will not run at any cost. It will execute the code that we have provided.

But this JVM is not platform independent like it will not run in IOS so we can not say Java is platform independent because it need JVM to run in the setup and JVM will not run in the IOS.

And we need JVM to run our Java code. But it doesnot understand english language so we need something called compiler (javac) to convert our english Java code into byte code or Java code 

So when we run our Java code and we are runnign 10 or 1000 files so we need to specify our first file need to have main.
