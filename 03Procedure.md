# How Java Code Execution Works

Java code execution involves a series of steps from writing the code to running it in the environment. Here's how it works:

1. **Writing the Code**:

   - The process begins with writing Java code in plain English-like syntax. This code is typically written in a `.java` file.

2. **Compilation**:

   - The **Java Compiler (javac)** converts the Java code into **bytecode**, which is a platform-independent intermediate code.
   - The bytecode is saved in a `.class` file.

3. **Running the Code in JVM**:

   - The **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** loads the `.class` file and executes the bytecode.
   - The JVM provides the environment required for the code to run, including memory management, security checks, and error handling.

4. **Finding the Entry Point**:

   - The JVM looks for the `main` method in the class. This method acts as the entry point for the program:
     ```java
     public static void main(String[] args) {
         // Program execution starts here
     }
     ```

5. **Execution**:
   - The JVM interprets or compiles the bytecode into machine code suitable for the host operating system.
   - The program's output is generated based on the executed instructions.

### Key Components Involved

- **Compiler**: Translates Java code into bytecode.
- **JVM**: Executes the bytecode in a platform-independent environment.
- **Class Loader**: Loads the required classes into memory.
- **Bytecode Verifier**: Ensures the bytecode follows Java security rules.
- **Runtime Interpreter**: Converts bytecode into machine code for execution.

This procedure ensures that Java achieves its core promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere."
